NOTES TO OTHER MODDERS
for some reason, the 14th creature in creature_fanciful_pikachu has skin, then requiring the 2 next lines.	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:LEATHER:LEATHER_TEMPLATE_P17]
[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:PARCHMENT:PARCHMENT_TEMPLATE_P17]
why this happens I have no idea. also happened to the the 9th creature in creature_p17, which was light rider. I then switched it so shadowseeker(which already has skin) is in 9th place, and light rider doesn't need leather.
