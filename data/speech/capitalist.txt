who paid [PRO_POS] final debts
who was taken by a hostile takeover, indeed
whose grasp of the battleaxe wasn't as good as [PRO_POS] skill in finances
who is sadly currently in the company of the lust demons
whose lies killed it in the end
whose armor was low quality and mass-produced by [PRO_POS] company. makes you think, doesn't it
a capitalist that'd rather die than let his business lose money
who had the final bad decision of telling me "you can't possibly harm me, I'm rich.'
whose husband/wife will get a nice rejection on the life insurance
who should have paid the toll
who tried to use guile against a iron broadsword
who gave me too much interest
who charged too much for too little
who sure had some guts! *laughs*
who saw the point *laughs*
