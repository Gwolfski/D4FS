Please, don't start any trouble. my retirement is in a few weeks.
Please, don't start any trouble. I have a wife/husband and children.
Start any trouble, and my blade shall feel your blood.
Start any trouble, elf, and you shall know death.
Come on! Can't you wait until my break to start trouble?
Mind yourself.
