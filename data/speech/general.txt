whose foolish attempts to yield were disregarded
whose insignificant name I obviously recall, but my name is still far greater
a idiot, who didn't know the difference between a iron broadsword and a wooden toy sword
whose idea of a fight was a dance fight. my idea of a fight was ripping [PRO_POS] head off. you can see why I won the fight
who history will remember as a fool for trying to challenge me
whose zombie is much dumber than other zombies
a little pig, who thought he could challenge a lion such as me
who sure had some guts! *laughs*
