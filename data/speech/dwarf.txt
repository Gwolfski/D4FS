who stood shivering before my terrible might
who choose to run in the wrong direction
who was too drunk to put up a real fight
whose cowardly screams were a shame to [PRO_POS] race
who futilely attacked my legs
who hammer shattered on the anvil of my majesty
who forged [PRO_POS] own doom by challenging me
whose beard I wove into a funeral shroud
