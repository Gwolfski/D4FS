Your world has forgotten us. Well, I shall make you remember!
Pain will make you remember us!
Pain will make you fear us!
We were destroyed, but we shall rise again!
You think of us as a minor nuisance, don't you?
We were proud races once, each one of us. but, then YOUR KINDS came along and RUINED EVERYTHING! YOU WILL PAY!!!!!
Armok, slay the intruder!
Armok, slay them!
Armok, they will be a sacrifice unto thee.
One by one, most of our kind died. Shall you join them?
In Armok's name I slay!
Armok shall be great again!
After we slay your infernal races, we shall create a new golden age!
Forgotten ones are we. Forgotten by all. Pain shall burn the memory into your flesh!
A sacrifice I needed. Then you came along. Would you mind climbing into this altar, while I sharpen the *coughsacrifialcough* knife?
This is a minor setback. We will be back, and better than ever!
